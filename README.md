# Emotional-Sentimental-Analysis-Using-AWS-Lambda-AWS-Comprehend-
We have used AWS Lambda and Amazon Comprehend  for sentiment analysis to make Amazon Lex  bots in Amazon Connect more sympathetic.

#What if you knew that 10 callers in your Amazon Connect contact flow were likely to say “Agent!” in frustration in the next 30 seconds? Would you like to get to them before that happens? What if your bot was smart enough to admit, “I’m sorry this isn’t helping. Let me find someone for you.”?
